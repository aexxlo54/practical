    <!-- 
    Hey there,

    Just wanted to drop a quick message in this file! I'm happy to be on board as a Software Engineer Intern. Let the coding adventure begin!

    "Hello, World!" because, why not? It's like the initiation ritual for us coders, right? Excited to create some epic code, squash some bugs, and learn the ropes of this Git magic.

    Here's to countless commits, seamless merges, and a codebase that reflects my coding journey. Ready to dive into the world of Git and soak up all the knowledge.

    Let's make this internship legendary! 

    Cheers!
	Aemzzzz
